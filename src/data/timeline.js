A co-worker and I initially gathered user information manually by tallking to each individual and physically accessing their pc's. It didn't take long for this to get old. I suggested that we use WScript and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create an app that would pull this data for us over the network. Together, my co-worker and I developed a script to grab all of the information that we needed. The script took a few minutes to run, but was able to scan an entire department worth of computers and gave us all of the information that we needed, which saved us weeks worth of manual work."
